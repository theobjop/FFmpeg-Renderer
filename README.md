# FFmpeg-Renderer
An application which balances the rendering options for FFmpeg and renders it using an AVS script.
This makes rendering using FFmpeg easier for anyone. Comes complete with default settings which are the best for YouTube's upload.

## Information
I created this project because I was wasting a lot of time trying to figure out the x264 settings for FFmpeg.
The reason you should always be using FFmpeg is because it allows for more customization and faster encoding speeds.
Along with faster encoding speeds, you can change a lot of settings like adding a header called "faststart" which forces the file to
load faster on YouTube. This makes your videos spend less time processing after uploading and less time buffering when somebody watches it.

The amount of customization that FFmpeg allows is infinite. There are so many options that I created this program in order to change settings
on the fly so you can just open the program and run it.
